               Installation

  - There are two options for installation. If you have an EDB Postgres 
  Subscription, you can use the Interactive Installers provided via StackBuilder
  Plus or the RPMs from the yum.enterprisedb.com site. Otherwise, you can compile 
  the source code

  HDFS FDW Installation from Source Code

  To compile the [Hadoop][1] foreign data wrapper, we need Java Compiler,
  JDK Include files and the JVM Library.
  We have used jdk-8u111-linux-x64.tar.gz.

  * HiveClient library
  - Steps to compile hiveclient

  For C/C++ part:
  

    export JDK_INCLUDE:=/home/user/Projects/hadoop_fdw/jdk1.8.0_111/include
    export INSTALL_DIR:=/opt/PPAS_PG/version/lib

    cd libhive
    make
    make install


  
  For Java part:


    javac MsgBuf.java
    javac HiveJdbcClient.java
    jar cf HiveJdbcClient-1.0.jar *.class
    cp HiveJdbcClient-1.0.jar /path/to/install/folder/lib/postgresql/
  

  Now that all the required dependencies are built we can build and install the fdw.

  - Steps to compile the HDFS FDW source code
  
  To build on POSIX-compliant systems you need to ensure the `pg_config` 
  executable is in your path when you run `make`. This executable is typically in 
  your PostgreSQL installation's `bin` directory. For example:

    export PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH

    make USE_PGXS=1
    make USE_PGXS=1 install

  Please note that the HDFS_FDW extension has only been tested on ubuntu and CentOS
  systems but it should work on other *UNIX's systems without any problems.
  
  
  * How To Start Hadoop.
  The detail installation instruction of Hadoop can be found on this [site][5]. 
  Here are the steps to start and stop the Hadoop.
   
  * Stop and start Hdfs on Single Node
  # sbin/stop-dfs.sh
  # sbin/start-dfs.sh
  
  * YARN on Single Node
  # sbin/stop-yarn.sh
  # sbin/start-yarn.sh
  
  * Starting HiveServer2
  cd /usr/local/hive/
  bin/hive --service hiveserver2
  
  ##Regression
  
  To execute the Regression, follow the below steps.
  
  1.  Open /etc/hosts and add the following line (the IP Address is of the Hive 
      Server Machine).
  
      `127.0.0.1 hive.server`
  
  2.  Run Hive Server using the following command.
  
      `./hive --service hiveserver2`
  
  3.  Load sample data for the test cases by using the following command.
  
      `hdfs_fdw/test/insert_hive.sh`

  4.  Execute the Regression using the following command.
  
      `hdfs_fdw/make installcheck`
